title: "Plant Insect Interaction - A Metaweb Analysis"
---

The complex interactions between plants and insects are foundational to maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. Switzerland, with its varied landscapes and distinct ecological zones, provides an ideal setting to study these dynamics. This research project focuses on developing trait-matching algorithms to quantify plant-insect interactions and conducting robustness analysis on constructed metawebs to assess their resilience against environmental perturbations.
By combining trait-based approaches with network analysis, this study seeks to understand the mechanisms driving plant-insect interactions and the factors that influence network stability in Switzerland's ecosystems.

## Methods

### Data Collection
- **Study Sites**: Selection of diverse habitats across Switzerland, including alpine meadows, lowland forests, and agricultural landscapes.
- **Interaction Observations**: Field surveys documenting plant traits (e.g., flower size, color, nectar availability) and insect traits (e.g., proboscis length, body size).
- **Temporal Sampling**: Repeated observations across seasons to capture dynamic interactions.

### Trait Matching Algorithm
- **Complementary Traits**: Development of algorithms to score interactions based on overlap between plant and insect traits, such as proboscis length vs. nectar tube depth.
- **Barrier Traits**: Encoding binary and decay-based scores for traits like flowering period mismatches and morphological incompatibilities.
- **Dynamic Modeling**: Incorporation of trait variability and stochasticity to simulate real-world interaction patterns.

### Network Construction and Analysis
- **Metaweb Construction**: Aggregation of all observed plant-insect interactions into a comprehensive metaweb.
- **Network Metrics**: Calculation of robustness metrics, including connectance, nestedness, and modularity.
- **Robustness Analysis**: Simulation of species loss scenarios (e.g., pollinator decline) to assess the resilience of interaction networks.

## Results
Expected results include:
1. **Trait Matching Insights**: Identification of key traits driving interaction specificity and generality.
2. **Metaweb Structure**: Characterization of network properties, including highly connected species and functional redundancies.
3. **Robustness Patterns**: Understanding how network resilience varies across different habitats and under simulated perturbations.

## Conclusion
This project aims to bridge trait-based ecology and network theory, providing insights into the stability of plant-insect interactions in Switzerland. The findings will contribute to conservation efforts by identifying critical species and interactions that sustain ecosystem functioning.

## Future Work
Future directions include:
- Scaling up the approach to include additional taxa and regions.
- Integrating climate change scenarios into robustness analyses.
- Collaborating with policymakers to implement conservation strategies informed by network resilience.
