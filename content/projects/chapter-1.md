title: "Temporal and Spatial Stability of Plant Pollinator Networks in Coffee Agroforests"
---

The coffee agroforests of India host diverse plant-pollinator networks that contribute significantly to both agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Understanding the temporal and spatial stability of these networks is crucial to identifying factors that sustain ecosystem services while balancing the economic needs of coffee farmers. This research project aims to investigate how seasonal changes, habitat heterogeneity, and farming practices affect the structure and stability of plant-pollinator interactions in coffee agroforests. 
By studying temporal variations (e.g., seasonal blooming and pollinator activity) and spatial variations (e.g., farm size and native versus exotic tree cover), this research seeks to provide actionable insights into promoting resilience in these ecosystems.

## Methods

### Field Data Collection
- **Study Area**: Coffee agroforests in Coorg, India, representing a gradient of farm sizes and vegetation compositions.
- **Temporal Data**: Surveys conducted across multiple seasons to track changes in plant blooming periods and pollinator activity.
- **Spatial Data**: Stratified sampling to assess plant-pollinator interactions in farms with varying levels of native and exotic tree cover.

### Network Analysis
- **Bipartite Networks**: Construction of plant-pollinator interaction networks using field observations.
- **Stability Metrics**: Calculation of metrics such as nestedness, connectance, and modularity to evaluate network stability over time and space.
- **Stochastic Simulations**: Incorporation of species-specific traits and stochastic rewiring to model potential future changes in network dynamics.

### Socio-Economic Surveys
- **Farmer Interviews**: Assessing the impact of farming practices and economic constraints on habitat management.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Analyzing how government regulations on tree cover influence ecological stability.

## Results
Results are expected to highlight:
1. **Temporal Trends**: Seasonal variations in network structure and their implications for pollination services.
2. **Spatial Patterns**: Differences in network stability between farms with native and exotic tree cover.
3. **Socio-Economic Correlations**: The role of farm size and management practices in shaping network dynamics.

## Conclusion
This project will provide critical insights into the interplay between ecological stability and socio-economic factors in coffee agroforests. The findings aim to inform adaptive management strategies that promote biodiversity conservation while ensuring sustainable coffee production.

## Future Work
Potential directions include:
- Expanding the study to include other agroforestry systems.
- Investigating the role of climate change in altering plant-pollinator interactions.
- Developing predictive models to guide farmer interventions based on network resilience.
